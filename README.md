## About Project

On this project, I built a simple REST API with a domain model of an ordering application just to develop my skills with the Java Spring Boot framework.

This is a simple project developed just for tests, it does not have an authentication method and it should not used in production.

Some of technologies used:

* Java 17
* Maven
* Spring Boot Framework 3.2
* JPA/Hibernate
* H2 (in-memory relational database)
